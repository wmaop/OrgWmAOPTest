Scenario: test before
Given chkBefore assertion before service pub.math:addInts when total == 5 && aValue == 4 && num1 == 5 && num2 == 4
When invoke org.wmaop.test.services:addInts without idata
Then assertion chkBefore was invoked 1 times

Scenario: test after
Given chkBefore assertion after service pub.math:addInts when total == 5 && aValue == 4 && num1 == 5 && num2 == 4 && value == 9
When invoke org.wmaop.test.services:addInts without idata
Then assertion chkBefore was invoked 1 times

Scenario: test transformer before
Given chkBefore assertion before service pub.math:addInts when total == null && aValue == null && num1 == 5 && num2 ==4
When invoke org.wmaop.test.services:addIntsTransformer without idata
Then assertion chkBefore was invoked 1 times

Scenario: test transformer after
Given chkBefore assertion after service pub.math:addInts when total == null && aValue == null && num1 == 5 && num2 == 4 && value == 9
When invoke org.wmaop.test.services:addIntsTransformer without idata
Then assertion chkBefore was invoked 1 times
